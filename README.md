# Library

This section should be used to state the purpuse of the library.

## Motivation

The central problem that justify the creation of this library, this makes clear the relevance of the solution.

## Usage

Maybe some small text that gives a broad sense of how to library is used than a call to let's start installing our package and keep the explanation going on. 

### Installation

Install with npm with the command `npm install @joaomelo/library`

### Getting Started

Here you describe the basic usage scenario of the library.

    //a.js
    import { bla } from '@joaomelo/library';

    function callback(){
      console.log(payload);
    };

    bla(callback);

Then you can ....

    //b.js
    import { blabla } from '@joaomelo/library';

    blabla('ahhh');

### Some edge case sections

If the library use gets complex sections could be created to address more features.

## Wrapping up

Maybe some ending message to state pitfalls or trade-offs. Totally optional.
